0) various small fixes
  * add legend to each tag help screen, e.g. ccat("silver", "Example: objects$time$...")
  * defer: extract object from "artifacts$class$lm$value"

1) re-plot a stored plot

2) return a tibble with objects from a query under $value

3) do not store (task_callback): query, query result, repository;
   ignore attributes assigned by the repository and ui packages

4) there could be a state of search, initiated by the "objects" keyword
   and later stored as "search"; every subsequent query would further
   narrow the list of results; this could be useful if the search term
   cannot be easily expressed as a $ key; e.g.

   > objects$other
   [search]> x ~ y + z
   * here the search engine recognizes a formula and searches tags for
     objects that match it in any given way; it then saves the result
     under "search" where from it can be built on
   > search$class$lm
   * this includes the previous formula search step

5) maintain a history of searches (and their results?)

6) topics for research when data on how this package is used is available:
   * many similar objects: how to exclude artifacts leading up to the final
     one; e.g. multiple plots slowly converging on the desired way of
     presenting data; discover those that are only approximations of that
     final one and "hide" them in the search results, or show only if
     explicitly asked to
